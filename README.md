# Fraud Detection Simulator
This code has been created by Ren√©e Theunissen for her Master Thesis at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS).

## Use
This code can be used to simulate selection bias and observe the effects over time. 

The `fraud detector` can be used for single predictions, while the `transactions over time` can be used to see the 
transactions over time.
