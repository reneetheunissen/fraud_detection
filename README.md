# Fraud Detection Simulator
This code has been created by Ren√©e Theunissen for her Master Thesis at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS).

## Use
This code can be used to simulate selection bias and observe the effects over time. 

Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection and save the `fraudTrain.csv` and 
`fraudTest.csv` in the fraud_detection folder. Hence, on the same level as this ReadMe. Now the code can be run.

The `fraud detector` can be used for single predictions, while the `transactions over time` can be used to see the 
transactions over time.

In scenarios there are three files that show how the code can be used.
- `metrics_over_time.py` shows how to plot the metrics over time and provided the probability to use active learning
- `RQ2_metrics_per_observed_fraud_rate.py` shows how to plot the metrics for all possible observed fraud rates for males
- `RQ2_random_sampling.py` prints the metrics by using random sampling instead of all possible OFR.
